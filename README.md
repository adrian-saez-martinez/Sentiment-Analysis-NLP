This project covers different Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text data and determine whether it indicates signs of depression. By using a dataset of twits and applying different techniques, I tried to predict whether a message exhibits signs of depression.

## Code Overview

The project uses Python and the scikit-learn library to build a depression detection model. Here's a brief overview of the key steps:

1. **Libraries**: We start by importing the required Python libraries for data processing and machine learning.

2. **Dataset**: We load a dataset specifically prepared for sentiment analysis.

3. **Preprocessing**: The text data is split into features (X) and labels (y). In this case, the labels represent depression (1) or non-depression (0).

4. **Model creation and training**: We build a Naive Bayes classifier and train it using the training data.

5. **Model evaluation**: The model makes predictions on the test data, and we evaluate its performance, including accuracy and a classification report.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can use Python's package manager, pip, to install dependencies mentioned in the code.

3. **Run the Code**: Use the provided Python script to load data, preprocess it, train the depression detection model, and make predictions. Detailed instructions can be found within the code.

## Dataset
